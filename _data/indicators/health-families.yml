  description: In Sacramento from 2008 to 2011, there were 5509 births by mothers under 20.  The data shows a slight decline in births by mother under the age of 20 by almost a half of a percent perhaps due to education and awareness. Zip codes included are 95812 through 95835, 95838, 95841, 95842, 95864.
